## 🔍 Why This Repo?

Most coding problem repositories provide only **code**. This repo goes a step further:

- Problems are **decoded in plain English** with **visuals, analogies, and step-by-step explanations**.
- Shows **why** and **how** a solution works, not just the final code.
- Great for **beginners** and **interview prep** alike.
